/**
 * Created by williaz on 11/5/16.
 * exceptions alter the program flow.
 * In general, try to avoid return codes(==use special value for return).
 * <p></p>
 * Error means something went so horribly wrong. No OK or required to catch.
 * that your program should not attempt to recover from it.
 * Runtime exceptions(unchecked) tend to be unexpected but not necessarily fatal.
 * Checked exceptions tend to be more anticipated -> handle or declare rule (throws).
 * <- might reasonably be expected to recover from.
 * <p></p>
 * not compiling VS throwing an exception.
 * <p></p>
 * If it is impossible for one of the catch blocks to be executed, a compiler error
 * about unreachable code occurs. This happens when a superclass is caught before a subclass.<br>
 * To review catching multiple exceptions, remember that at most one catch block will run
 * and it will be the fi rst catch block that can handle it.
